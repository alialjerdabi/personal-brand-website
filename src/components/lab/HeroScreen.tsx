 * The opening: a pale wash, a floating nav, and one sentence said in the
 * first person with the work set into it.
 *
 * THE ENTRANCE IS ONE IDEA: the sentence arrives the way it would be
 * spoken — left to right, in reading order, one unit at a time. Words
 * rise, and when the line reaches a slot where work belongs, the stills
 * drop into it at that exact moment; when it reaches the gesture, the
 * arrow draws itself. Nothing animates out of sequence, because every
 * element's timing is a function of its position in the sentence rather
 * than of which effect it happens to use.
 *
 * The previous version fired five separate tweens on hand-tuned offsets
 * after a two-second wait left over from a deleted loading screen, which
 * is exactly why it read as random.
 *
 * Everything renders visible from the server. The entrance masks itself
 * in a pre-paint layout effect and only when motion is allowed, so no-JS
 * and reduced-motion visitors get the finished composition immediately.

          the nav cleared — the type is as large as a consistent margin
          allows, rather than as large as the viewport allows.

          tail is pushed to the bottom edge with `mt-auto`. Centring left
          a third of the viewport empty above AND below, which is what
          made a large headline read as a small one on a big page.
        - No `text-balance`: balancing evens lines by shortening all of
          them and held the statement to 68% of the viewport. The breaks
          are hand-placed in the content instead.
        - Centred, per Ali's direction. Left-aligned the ragged right edge
          left a visible gap on wide screens that read as dead margin
          rather than as rag; centring balances it against both gutters.
