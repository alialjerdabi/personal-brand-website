/**
 * Screenshot the running dev server so the work can actually be looked at.
 *
 * Every visual defect this project shipped — an arrow with no arrowhead, a
 * headline rendering behind the navbar, an ID card hanging outside the
 * camera frustum, a full-page canvas swallowing every click — was
 * invisible to type-checking and to DOM measurement, and obvious in a
 * screenshot. This script is the difference between guessing and seeing.
 *
 *   node scripts/shots.mjs                  # every route, every width
 *   node scripts/shots.mjs /lab             # one route
 *   node scripts/shots.mjs /lab 1600        # one route, one width
 *
 * Writes PNGs to .shots/ (git-ignored).
